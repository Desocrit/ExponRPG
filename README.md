# ExponRPG

ExponRPG was mostly a recent warm-up project, designed to be a simple reminder of the basic functions of java, and an exercise in writing high quality, well documented code. The current working build is extremely rudimentary, consisting of a basic interface and standard movement functionality. The main purpose of this repo is so that the code can be examined - I would consider this a good up-to-date example of my current standard of code.
